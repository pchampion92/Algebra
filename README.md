TODO:

Gauss inversion algorithm
SVD decomposition
LU decomposition
    Similar to Gaussian inversion
    Input matrix should be square
QR decomposition 
    Gram Schmidt approach (OK)
    Householder approach (KO)
Cholesky decomposition
    Input matrix should be symmetric and definite positive
    Use LDL* for stability of results (do not need to square the values) 
Linear system solver
Eigenvalue decomposition 
    for n>=5, there is no solution in radicals to general polynomials equations of degree fixe or hire with arbitrary coefficients
Polar decomposition
